# project-kubernetes-twingate

rough noteson what to mention:
- how to install twingate connector (also a specific seciton that if you  use wsl, you just need the windows client installed and that will be enough for it to work)
- how to get you twingate: groupID, API key,
- updating the terraform variables and provider configurations with the correct information
